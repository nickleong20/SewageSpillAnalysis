The public is advised to avoid contact with the water within the drainage ditch as it is a mixture of sewage and storm water. The discharge is not believed to have reached coastal waters.

The DOH Clean Water Branch began investigating a sewage spill from a private commercial property located along Farrington Hwy., across from Ala Poko St. in Waianae Mall on Feb. 6, 2018.

The sewage flowed from the broken lateral onto Farrington Highway before collecting in a drainage ditch that ends at the Lualualei Beach Park. 

The Clean Water Branch has notified the owners of the damaged sewage lateral who are required to remove contaminated water from the drainage ditch to prevent further damage to the environment and risk to human health. The Clean Water Branch is continuing to monitor the area and investigate the cause of the sewage spill. 

The DOH Clean Water Branch responds to sewage spills which reach state waters. The Clean Water Branch protects public health and the environment by prohibiting discharges which impair water quality, keeping Hawaii’s waters fishable and swimmable for everyone.
