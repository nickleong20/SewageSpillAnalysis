**Readme: Sewage Spill Analysis App**

Welcome to the Sewage Overflow Spill Analysis App repository! This application provides an interactive platform for analyzing historical sewage overflow spills across the Hawaiian islands. Users can explore patterns, trends, and summary statistics related to sewage spills, aiding in decision-making for infrastructure upgrades and environmental management.

**Features:**
- **Interactive Map**: Utilize an interactive leaflet map to visualize sewage spill locations across different islands, watersheds, and timeframes.
- **Real-Time Filtering**: Filter spill data by date range, island, and watershed, with the map automatically updating to reflect user inputs.
- **Summary Statistics**: Obtain summary statistics such as the total number of sewage spill locations and gallons spilled within selected areas.
- **Data Visualization**: View color-coded and expandable data clusters on the map, identifying affected regions at a glance.
- **Detailed Insights**: Access specific location data by clicking on map markers, with a downloadable data table available for selected inputs.

**Limitations:**
- **Data Completeness**: The accuracy of summary statistics may be affected by incomplete information on effluent releases in the source sewage overflow data.
- **Spatial Precision**: Some sewage overflow spill locations may lack precise coordinates, potentially impacting spatial analysis accuracy.

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Shiny application file (`app.R`) in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Run the application to explore sewage spill data interactively.
